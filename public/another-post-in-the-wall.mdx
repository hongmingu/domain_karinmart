This is an example post, with a [link](https://nextjs.org) and a React component:
![하이 헬로우 이미지설명](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a/AAcHTtdchAGf81_wa9FfHBMnbcFb5x_CxsVzPtzD7Wk8rmoJ=s192-c-br100-rg-mo)
![하이 헬로우 이미지설명](/IMG_6749.JPG)
<video src="/FickleGlassBass.mp4" controls>
  Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

The title and description are pulled from the MDX file and processed using `gray-matter`. Additionally, links are rendered using a custom component passed to `next-mdx-remote`.
